HTTP GET Request with Observable + Async Pipe in Angular

What’s New in This Approach?
No need for manual .subscribe() in the component.
async pipe handles both subscription and unsubscription.
Cleaner code and fewer memory leaks.
Can easily be extended with operators like map, catchError, etc.

Step-by-Step Refactor from Subscription to Observable Binding
1️⃣ Component Code

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  standalone: true,
  templateUrl: './user.component.html'
})
export class UserComponent {
  responseData$!: Observable<any>;
  loadData: boolean = false;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    this.responseData$ = this.http.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
    this.loadData = true;
  }
}

Notes:
responseData$ is suffixed with $ to indicate it's an Observable.
No manual .subscribe() — the async pipe in the template will handle it.

2️⃣ Template Code with async Pipe and Table Format

<button (click)="getData()">Get Data</button>

<ng-container *ngIf="loadData">
  <table *ngIf="responseData$ | async as users">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Email</th>
        <th>Phone</th>
        <th>Address</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr *ngFor="let user of users">
        <td>{{ user.name }}</td>
        <td>{{ user.email }}</td>
        <td>{{ user.phone }}</td>
        <td>{{ user.address.street }}, {{ user.address.city }}</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</ng-container>

Why This Approach Is Better?

Feature	                Traditional .subscribe()	       With async Pipe
Subscription handling 	Manual	                          Automatic
Unsubscribing	          Must do manually (risk of leak)	  Auto-handled by Angular
Syntax	                More code	                        Cleaner and declarative
Template binding	    Requires storing data manually	    Reactive and direct in template


Summary
You converted a manually subscribed HTTP GET request into an Observable-based flow.
Leveraged the async pipe to simplify subscription and template rendering.
Displayed structured, specific data (name, email, etc.) in a clean table format.
This approach aligns with best practices in modern Angular development.
