HTTP DELETE Request in Angular
What is the DELETE Method?
The DELETE request is used to remove resources from the server.
It usually includes a resource identifier (e.g., user ID) in the URL to specify which record to delete.
The server responds with a status message indicating success or failure.

Static DELETE Request Example

deleteData() {
  this.http.delete('http://localhost:3000/users/104').subscribe(
    response => {
      console.log('User deleted:', response);
    },
    error => {
      console.error('Delete failed:', error);
    }
  );
}

Dynamic DELETE Request with Input Field
Use Case:
Allow users to enter an ID in an input field, and delete the corresponding user.

Component Code (TypeScript)
userId: string = '';

deleteData() {
  if (!this.userId.trim()) {
    alert('Please enter a user ID to delete.');
    return;
  }

  this.http.delete(`http://localhost:3000/users/${this.userId}`).subscribe(
    response => {
      console.log(`User with ID ${this.userId} deleted.`, response);
    },
    error => {
      console.error('Delete failed:', error);
    }
  );
}

Template Code (HTML)
<input [(ngModel)]="userId" placeholder="Enter User ID to delete" />
<button (click)="deleteData()">Delete User</button>
