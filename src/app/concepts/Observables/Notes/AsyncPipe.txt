 Async Pipe in Angular
What is the Async Pipe?
The Async Pipe in Angular allows you to subscribe to an Observable or a Promise directly inside the template.

It automatically handles:
Subscribing when the component loads.
Updating the view when new values arrive.
Unsubscribing automatically when the component is destroyed (to prevent memory leaks).
This avoids manual subscribe()/unsubscribe() code, making the application simpler and cleaner.

Why Use the Async Pipe?
Removes manual subscription code.
Avoids memory leaks (auto unsubscribe).
Improves code readability and maintainability.
Simplifies displaying real-time or asynchronous data in templates.

Example: Basic Usage
Component Code:

import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';
import { delay } from 'rxjs/operators';

export class DemoComponent {
  value$: Observable<string>;

  constructor() {
    this.value$ = of('Observable emitted value').pipe(delay(2000));
  }
}
Template Code:
<p>{{ value$ | async }}</p>

value$ is an observable (note the $ suffix as a naming convention).

async pipe subscribes automatically and displays the emitted value after 2 seconds.

No need to write .subscribe() or .unsubscribe() manually.

Important Behavior
For an Observable, the async pipe:
Subscribes to the stream.
Renders every emitted value.
For a Promise, the async pipe:
Waits for it to resolve.
Renders the resolved value only once.

More Examples
1. Iterating Observable Arrays:

If you have an observable emitting an array:

numbers$: Observable<number[]> = of([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
In the template:
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let number of numbers$ | async">{{ number }}</li>
</ul>
You can directly loop over an observable array!

2. Working with Promises:

promiseMessage = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Promise Resolved!'), 2000);
});
In the template:

<p>{{ promiseMessage | async }}</p>
When the promise resolves after 2 seconds, the message appears!

Questions and Answers:

1. What is the Async Pipe?	An Angular pipe that subscribes to Observables and Promises directly in the template and manages unsubscription automatically.
2. How does it work with Observables?	Subscribes to the observable, listens for emissions, updates the view with new values, and unsubscribes when the component is destroyed.
3. How does it work with Promises?	Waits for the promise to resolve and displays the final resolved value in the template.

Observable + Async Pipe → Listens to multiple emissions (real-time values).
Promise + Async Pipe → Listens once to the final resolved value.
No manual subscription or memory leak worries anymore!
