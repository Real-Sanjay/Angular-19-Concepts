What is the purpose of the subscribe method in observables?
The subscribe() method is used to listen to the data emitted by an Observable.

When you subscribe:
The Observable starts emitting values.
The Observer (your code) can react to these values, errors, or the completion signal.

It connects an Observable to an Observer.

It allows your application to react to asynchronous data, like HTTP responses, user events, or timers.


 Why is it called Reactive Programming in the context of RxJS?
 It's called "reactive" because applications react to data changes, events, or asynchronous streams automatically.

 RxJS provides tools to observe and respond to data events as they happen, without blocking the flow.

 It is heavily based on the Observer Pattern, where the system listens and reacts to emitted values over time.


Key Concepts Summary:

Concept	                       Meaning
Synchronous                    Tasks that happen immediately, one after another.
Asynchronous	               Tasks that take time (e.g., HTTP calls, user input), allowing other code to continue running.
RxJS	                       A third-party JavaScript library for handling asynchronous operations using Observables.
Observable	                   A class from RxJS that emits data streams over time.
Observer	                   An object that listens and reacts to values emitted by an Observable.
Subscribe	                   The method to start listening to an Observable's emissions.
Reactive Programming	       Programming style that reacts automatically to events or data changes.

Example Code:

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>Check the Console</h1>`
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  myObservable = new Observable((observer) => {
    console.log('Observable starts');
    observer.next('First Data Chunk');
    observer.next('Second Data Chunk');
    observer.complete(); // Ends the Observable
  });

  ngOnInit() {
    this.myObservable.subscribe({
      next: (data) => console.log('Received:', data),
      error: (err) => console.error('Error:', err),
      complete: () => console.log('Observable Completed!')
    });
  }
}
Console Output:

Observable starts
Received: First Data Chunk
Received: Second Data Chunk
Observable Completed!

Tip:
You can use operators like map(), filter(), retry(), catchError() with observables to manipulate or handle data streams easily.

We will learn operators next after mastering basic observables and subscription.
