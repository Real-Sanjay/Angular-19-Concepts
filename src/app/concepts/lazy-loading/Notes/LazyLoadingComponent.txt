 Lazy Loading vs Eager Loading in Angular

What is Eager Loading?
Default behavior in Angular.
All modules/components load immediately when the application starts.

Pros:
Easy to set up.

Cons:
Can slow down the initial load time if app is large.

What is Lazy Loading?
Modules/components are loaded only when needed.
Improves initial load speed by keeping the starting bundle size smaller.

Useful for:
Feature modules
Heavy components
Less frequently used parts (admin panels, settings, dashboards)

Angular's New Feature: Lazy Loading Standalone Components (since Angular 14+)
Earlier, Angular supported lazy loading only for modules.
Now, standalone components can also be lazy-loaded!

 Example
Create two components: FirstComponent and SecondComponent.

Define routes:
/first → FirstComponent (eager)
/second → SecondComponent (lazy)

How to Configure Lazy Loading for Components
Eager Loading (default way):
code:
{
  path: 'first',
  component: FirstComponent
}
Lazy Loading using loadComponent:
code:
{
  path: 'second',
  loadComponent: () => import('./second/second.component').then(m => m.SecondComponent)
}
loadComponent returns a Promise which resolves to the component.
Load only when the route is activated!

Important Rule
Don't use both component and loadComponent in the same route.
If you do, you'll get this error:

Invalid configuration of route. Component and loadComponent cannot be used together.

How to See Lazy Loading in Action
Open DevTools → Network → JS.

Initially:
Only first component's chunk is loaded.
After clicking the second component's button:
Second component's chunk is downloaded on demand.

Once loaded, it's cached. No second download unless you hard-refresh the page.

When to Use Lazy Loading
Scenario	                                     Recommendation
Core functionality (Login, Home)	             Eager load
Feature modules (Settings, Admin Panel)	         Lazy load
Rarely used routes (Reports, Advanced settings)	 Lazy load

Overusing lazy loading can backfire if not planned properly because it may introduce small loading delays when the user navigates for the first time.

In Short:

Eager Loading	                Lazy Loading
Load everything at startup	    Load on demand
Bigger initial bundle	        Smaller initial bundle
Fast navigation later	        Slight delay when navigating for the first time
Good for critical features	    Good for optional/rarely used features

Final Notes
Lazy loading improves performance but must be used smartly.
Use loadComponent for standalone components.
Always test user experience after applying lazy loading to make sure navigation feels smooth.
