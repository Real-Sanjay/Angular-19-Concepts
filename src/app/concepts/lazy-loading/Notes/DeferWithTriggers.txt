@defer + Triggers
When you use @defer {} in Angular, you can control when the deferred (lazy) content starts loading using Triggers.

Built-in Triggers in @defer

Trigger Name	                                                            Meaning	Example Use Case
on idle	Wait until browser is idle (default trigger)	                    After page fully loads and is free, load extra content.
on viewport	When element appears inside visible screen (viewport)	        Load components only when user scrolls down.
on interaction	When user interacts (click, keypress) with a given element	Load something when user clicks a button.
on hover	When user hovers mouse over an element	                        Load user details when hovering on user name.
on immediate	Load immediately as soon as page renders	                Load a banner or message immediately.
on timer	Load after a certain delay (time based)                     	Load suggestions after 3 seconds of staying idle.


One Line Concept of Each
on idle ➔ Wait until browser is relaxed, then load.

on viewport ➔ When you scroll and item comes into view, then load.

on interaction ➔ When you click or press something, then load.

on hover ➔ When you hover mouse over something, then load.

on immediate ➔ Load immediately, no waiting.

on timer ➔ Load after specific number of seconds/milliseconds.


Practical Example

@defer (on idle) {
  <h2>Load content when browser is idle</h2>
}

@defer (on viewport) {
  <h2>Load content when I scroll here!</h2>
}

@defer (on interaction showButton) {
  <h2>Load when I click the "Show" button</h2>
}
<button #showButton>Show</button>

@defer (on hover userCard) {
  <h2>Load when mouse hovers over this card!</h2>
}
<div #userCard>Hover over me!</div>

@defer (on immediate) {
  <h2>Load immediately after render</h2>
}

@defer (on timer 3000) {
  <h2>Load after 3 seconds</h2>
}

Note:
If you use on viewport without a placeholder, Angular will give an error.

Solution: either give a @placeholder block, or pass a reference to an element like on viewport elementRef.

@loading can help show a spinner/message during the waiting period.

 Why triggers are useful?
 They optimize page speed by loading content only when needed.
 They reduce initial loading time by not loading everything immediately.
 They improve user experience by showing quick visible parts first and lazy loading the rest.


Without defer                   With defer
Load everything at once	        Load only important first, rest later
Slow first load	                Fast first load
Heavy DOM memory	            Light DOM memory initially
