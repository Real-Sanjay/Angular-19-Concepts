NoPreloading Strategy in Angular
What is NoPreloading?
NoPreloading means no background preloading of lazy-loaded modules.
Modules/components are loaded only when the user navigates to their route.
No preloading HTTP calls happen during app initialization.

Example
Suppose you have two lazily loaded routes:
const routes = [
  { path: 'first', loadComponent: () => import('./first.component').then(m => m.FirstComponent) },
  { path: 'second', loadComponent: () => import('./second.component').then(m => m.SecondComponent) }
];

In app.config.ts, to disable preloading:

import { provideRouter, withPreloading } from '@angular/router';
import { NoPreloading } from '@angular/router';

export const appConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes, withPreloading(NoPreloading))
  ]
};

Now:
Only the first component loads if that's the initial route.
The second component does NOT load until the user navigates to /second.

Behavior Comparison

Preloading Strategy	            Behavior
PreloadAllModules	            Preloads all lazy routes after app starts
NoPreloading	                Loads modules only when user navigates

Important Points about NoPreloading
Reduces initial data transfer: Since only necessary resources are loaded initially.
Does not necessarily make the app faster: Navigation might feel slower when the user visits lazy routes for the first time.
Best for: Apps with large modules that aren't needed immediately.
Not ideal for: Modules/routes that users visit frequently — because it causes a small navigation delay.

FAQs 


What is the default preloading strategy in Angular?	The default is NoPreloading. Angular only loads lazy-loaded modules when their route is accessed.
When should you use NoPreloading?	When you have large lazy modules that would negatively impact the app's startup time if preloaded.
Does NoPreloading always improve speed?	No. It reduces initial load size, but first navigation to lazy routes may feel slower.
Should I preload everything?	No. Preload only routes that are frequently visited or critical for user experience.
