Preloading in Angular

What is Preloading?
Preloading means loading lazily loaded components/modules in the background.
They are loaded after the app initializes, before the user requests them.
Execution (displaying the page/component) still happens only when needed.
Improves navigation speed because the components are ready in memory.

Preloading vs Lazy Loading

Lazy Loading	                                    Preloading
Load modules only when user navigates	            Load modules in background after app starts
Might cause a slight delay when user navigates	    No delay when user navigates
Saves bandwidth if user never visits the route	    Can increase initial background traffic

How to Implement Preloading
You already have lazy loading using loadComponent.
Now to preload those components:

Go to app.config.ts.

Find the provideRouter(routes) function.

Add the withPreloading() function.

Example:

import { provideRouter, withPreloading } from '@angular/router';
import { PreloadAllModules } from '@angular/router';

export const appConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes, withPreloading(PreloadAllModules))
  ]
};

  This tells Angular:
→ After the app finishes loading, start preloading all lazy-loaded routes in the background.

Preloading Strategies in Angular

Strategy	            Description
NoPreloading	        (default) - No preloading, only lazy loading happens
PreloadAllModules	    Preload all lazy-loaded modules immediately after the app loads
Custom Preloading	    You can write your own logic to preload based on conditions (user roles, device type, etc.)

Example: Behavior of Preloading
When preloading is applied:
Lazy-loaded routes' JS files are downloaded silently.
Components aren't rendered until user actually navigates.
When user clicks → instant navigation because it's already in browser memory.

If no preloading:
JS file is downloaded only when user clicks → small delay in showing the page.

Question	                                  Good Answer
What is preloading in Angular?	              Preloading loads lazily loaded modules in the background after app startup, before user navigates to them.
What is withPreloading?	                      It is an API to configure preloading strategies along with provideRouter().
What is PreloadAllModules?	                  A strategy that preloads all lazy-loaded routes immediately after the app loads to speed up navigation.
What if no preloading strategy is used?	      Angular only loads lazy-loaded modules when the user navigates, possibly causing navigation delays.

Final Important Points
Preloading does not mean the page is executed/rendered immediately.
It only downloads the route’s JS file in advance.
Helps in faster, smoother navigation later.
Choose preloading smartly depending on app size, network usage, and user behavior patterns.
