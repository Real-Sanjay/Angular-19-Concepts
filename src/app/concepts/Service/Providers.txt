What are Providers in Angular?
Providers tell Angular how to create and deliver dependencies (like services). Angular uses them to register services with the injector.
Without a provider, Angular doesn’t know how to create a service.

Three Ways to Provide a Service in Angular
1. At the Service Level (@Injectable) — Global Singleton
code:
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class MyService { }
Default when you generate a service using ng generate service.
Angular provides a single shared instance throughout the application.
Ideal for shared services like HttpService, AuthService, etc.

🟢 Scope: Global (Singleton)
🟢 Lifecycle: As long as the app runs.

2. At the Module Level (@NgModule)
code:
@NgModule({
  providers: [MyService]
})
export class AppModule { }
The service will be available only to components declared in this module.
Less common now since providedIn: 'root' handles most use cases.

🟡 Scope: Limited to the module
🟡 Lifecycle: As long as the module is active.

3. At the Component Level (@Component) — Multiple Instances
code:
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  providers: [MyService]
})
export class MyComponent { }
A new instance of the service is created for each instance of the component.

Useful for encapsulated state or behavior (e.g., temporary form data, per-user session).

🔴 Scope: Limited to the component and its children
🔴 Lifecycle: Tied to the component instance.

 Example
➤ PowerService
code:
export class PowerService {
  calculatePower(value: number, power: number): number {
    return Math.pow(value, power);
  }
}
➤ CubeService
code:
@Injectable()
export class CubeService {
  constructor(private powerService: PowerService) {}

  calculateCube(value: number): number {
    return this.powerService.calculatePower(value, 3);
  }
}
Note: PowerService doesn’t have @Injectable, so it can’t be injected unless instantiated manually like in CubeService.

➤ MyComponent
code:
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my',
  templateUrl: './my.component.html',
  providers: [CubeService, PowerService]
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private cubeService: CubeService) {}

  result = this.cubeService.calculateCube(4); // 64
}
Each MyComponent gets its own CubeService and PowerService.

If you had multiple instances of MyComponent, they wouldn’t share the same service instances.

Concept Questions and Answers
Q1: What is the role of providers in Angular?
Answer:
Providers tell Angular how to create instances of services for dependency injection. Without them, Angular cannot inject the required services.

Q2: How do you define providers at different levels?
Answer:

Component level:

code:
@Component({ providers: [MyService] })
Module level:

code:
@NgModule({ providers: [MyService] })
Service level:

code:
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
Q3: Can you provide multiple instances of the same service in different components?
Answer:
Yes. By providing the service at the component level, Angular will create a new instance of the service for each component instance. This way, changes in one component’s service instance do not affect others.

code:
@Component({ providers: [MyService] })
Q4: Can a service be injected into another service?
Answer:
Yes. One service can inject another using constructor injection, like:

code:
@Injectable()
export class ServiceB {
  constructor(private serviceA: ServiceA) {}
}
Just make sure ServiceA has @Injectable() defined.
