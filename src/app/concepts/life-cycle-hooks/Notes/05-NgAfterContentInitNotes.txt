What is ngAfterContentInit in Angular?
Definition:
ngAfterContentInit is a lifecycle hook in Angular that is called once after Angular projects external content into the component using <ng-content>.

When does it run?
It runs after the first ngDoCheck().
It is called only once, even if projected content changes later.

🧱 What is Content Projection?
➡️ Content Projection:
It's a technique used to pass HTML elements (not just data) from a parent component to a child component.

➡️ Why not @Input()?
@Input() passes primitive or object values, but not full HTML or templates. That’s where ng-content comes in.

🧩 Example:
Parent Component HTML:
<app-child>
  <div style="color: blue;">Projected content</div>
</app-child>

Child Component HTML:
<div>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>

🔄 Lifecycle Order (Simplified):
ngOnInit() → after component’s input properties initialized.

ngDoCheck() → runs on every change detection.

ngAfterContentInit() → after content (via <ng-content>) has been projected.


🔬 When to Use ngAfterContentInit?
Use it when:
You need to interact with projected content (from parent to child).
You are using @ContentChild() to access a projected DOM or component.
You want to run logic after the DOM inside <ng-content> is available.

💡 Difference Between ngOnInit() vs ngAfterContentInit()
Feature	                  ngOnInit()	                        ngAfterContentInit()
Trigger Time	          After component initialization	    After content is projected via <ng-content>
Projected Content Ready?  Not guaranteed	                    Yes
Called How Many Times?	  Once	                                Once
Use Case	              Setup input data, services, etc.	    Setup projected DOM, interact with content child

🛠️ Example: Using @ContentChild with ngAfterContentInit

// test.component.ts
@ContentChild('projectedDiv') projected!: ElementRef;

ngAfterContentInit() {
  console.log('ngAfterContentInit called');
  console.log('Projected Content:', this.projected.nativeElement);
}

Edit
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-test>
  <div #projectedDiv>I am projected content</div>
</app-test>

❓What Happens If Projected Content Changes Later?
ngAfterContentInit() is NOT called again.
Use ngDoCheck() or Angular’s reactive patterns (@Input(), BehaviorSubject, etc.) to detect updates.

Interview Style Questions and Answers
Q1: What is ngAfterContentInit?
It is a lifecycle hook that is called once after Angular has fully initialized all content projected into a component using <ng-content>.

Q2: When would you use ngAfterContentInit instead of ngOnInit?
When your logic depends on content projected from a parent using <ng-content>. Unlike ngOnInit, this hook guarantees that the projected content is fully available.

Q3: Does ngAfterContentInit run when projected content changes?
No. It runs only once. To handle updates, use ngDoCheck() or reactive patterns.
