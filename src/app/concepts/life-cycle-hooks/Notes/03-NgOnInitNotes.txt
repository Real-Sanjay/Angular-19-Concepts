What is ngOnInit?
A lifecycle hook called once after the component's data-bound properties are initialized.
Defined by implementing the OnInit interface from @angular/core.
Used for component initialization logic like setting up data, subscribing to services, or API calls.

code:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({...})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit(): void {
    console.log("ngOnInit - Component Initialized");
  }
}

Constructor vs ngOnInit
Feature	           Constructor	                                ngOnInit
Called	           When the component class is instantiated	   After Angular has fully initialized the component
Input Binding	     Not available	                             Available
Best for	         Simple initialization (e.g., DI)	           Component setup, fetching data, input-related logic


Example: Counter
code:
count = 0;
counterInterval: any;

startCounter() {
  this.counterInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (this.count <= 5) {
      this.count++;
    } else {
      clearInterval(this.counterInterval);
    }
  }, 1000);
}

ngOnInit(): void {
  this.startCounter(); // Start counting after component is fully initialized
}


Interview Questions Breakdown
1.Difference between constructor and ngOnInit?
Constructor runs first but doesn’t have access to input-bound values.
ngOnInit is lifecycle-aware and has access to bound inputs and services.

2.Can you fetch API data inside ngOnInit?
Yes. It’s the recommended place for that because Angular ensures that all dependencies and bindings are ready.

3.Is ngOnInit called multiple times?
No. It's only called once per component instance lifecycle.

4.What happens if you access @Input values in the constructor?
They will be undefined, since Angular hasn’t assigned them yet.

Child Component Example (Input Binding Timing)
Parent Component (App Component)
<app-child [inputValue]="parentValue"></app-child>

Child Component
code:
export class ChildComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() inputValue?: string;

  constructor() {
    console.log("Constructor:", this.inputValue); // undefined
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    console.log("ngOnInit:", this.inputValue); // 'Hello from App Component'
  }
}
This shows that @Input() values are not available in the constructor, but are available in ngOnInit.
