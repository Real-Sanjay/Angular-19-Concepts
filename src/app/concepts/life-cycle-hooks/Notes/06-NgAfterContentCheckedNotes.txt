What is ngAfterContentChecked() in Angular?
ngAfterContentChecked is a lifecycle hook in Angular that's triggered every time Angular checks the content projected into a component (via <ng-content>). This check happens after each change detection cycle.

Why is this important?
If you're using content projection (<ng-content>) and you want to perform logic when that content is re-checked, such as:
Logging or debugging
Validating inputs
Tracking changes in content
This hook helps you monitor or act every time that projected content is re-evaluated.

✅ Key Characteristics
Feature	            Description
🔁 Frequency	    Called every change detection cycle
🔄 Trigger	        Happens after Angular has checked projected content
🔍 Useful for	    Validation, debugging, dynamic content handling
⚠️ Warning	Can be a performance hit if the logic inside is heavy or poorly written


Practical Example Overview
Let’s say you’ve got a component like this:

🔹 Parent Template
html
<app-child>
  <h3 #projectedContent>Random Number: {{ data }}</h3>
</app-child>
<button (click)="generateRandom()">Generate</button>

🔹 Child Template
html
<div>
  <h2>Child Component</h2>
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>

🔹 Child Component.ts
ts
export class ChildComponent implements AfterContentChecked {
  ngAfterContentChecked(): void {
    console.log('ngAfterContentChecked - projected content checked');
  }
}

🔹 Parent Component.ts
ts

export class ParentComponent {
  data: number = 0;

  generateRandom() {
    this.data = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
  }
}

🧩 What happens under the hood?
When the component is first initialized, ngAfterContentChecked() is fired.
Any time the projected content ({{ data }}) updates (e.g., clicking "Generate"), it fires again.
Internally, Angular uses multiple checks (even double check in development mode) to ensure the component is stable and up-to-date — this is why you see it invoked multiple times.

📌 When would you use ngAfterContentChecked() instead of ngAfterContentInit()?

Hook	               When it's Called	                        Use Case Example
ngAfterContentInit	   Only once, after content is projected	Setup tasks after projection
ngAfterContentChecked  Every time content is checked	        Validation, re-evaluation, debugging

⚠️ Best Practice Reminder
Avoid expensive computations or DOM manipulations in this hook.
Don’t trigger change detection manually here (e.g., avoid updating values in this hook), or it can cause an infinite loop.
