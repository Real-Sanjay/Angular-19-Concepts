 What is ngOnChanges?
ngOnChanges is a lifecycle hook in Angular.
It is triggered every time there is a change in input properties (decorated with @Input()) of a component.
Useful for responding to changes passed from parent to child components.


🧪 Example Scenario Breakdown
🧱 Step-by-Step:
In AppComponent (Parent):

A property inputValue: string is defined.
The value of this property will be passed to the child.

Note:
Angular vs Regular Class Instantiation:
In a regular class, the constructor is triggered when using new.
Angular handles component instantiation behind the scenes, not with new.


In TestComponent (Child):
Implements OnChanges interface from Angular core.
Declares @Input() inputValue: string; to receive the prop.
Defines ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) method.
Binding Input in Template:

code:
<app-test [inputValue]="inputValue"></app-test>
inputValue inside [] is from child.
inputValue outside [] is from parent (AppComponent).

Inside ngOnChanges Method:

child component code:
ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
  console.log('ngOnChanges triggered');
  console.log(changes);
}
changes contains detailed metadata about input changes.

🧾 SimpleChanges Interface Properties:
When a change occurs, Angular provides an object of type SimpleChanges with the following:

Property	                Description
previousValue	            The previous value of the input property.
currentValue	            The new updated value of the input property.
firstChange	Boolean flag;   true if this is the first change.


💬 Common Questions
1. What is the purpose of ngOnChanges?
It detects and handles changes in component input properties.
Called before ngOnInit, whenever input properties change.

2. How is ngOnChanges different from ngOnInit?
ngOnChanges	                    ngOnInit
Called on every input change	Called once, after component init
Triggered before init	        Triggered after first change detection

3. Can it detect non-input property changes?
❌ No.
ngOnChanges only tracks changes to properties decorated with @Input().

When to Use ngOnChanges
Use this hook when:
You want to respond immediately to changes from parent components.
You need to track input history (previousValue vs currentValue).
You want to trigger logic (e.g., update fields, fetch data) based on changed input.
