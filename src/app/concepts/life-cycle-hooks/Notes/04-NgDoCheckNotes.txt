What is ngDoCheck in Angular?
ngDoCheck is a lifecycle hook that gets called during every change detection cycle.
It is used to implement custom change detection logic that Angular’s default mechanism may not catch.
Unlike ngOnChanges, which only detects changes in @Input() properties, ngDoCheck runs regardless of input changes, giving more manual control.


Key Differences: ngOnChanges vs ngDoCheck
Feature	    ngOnChanges	                                                ngDoCheck
Triggered	Only on changes to @Input() properties	                    Every change detection cycle
Parameters	Receives SimpleChanges with current/previous values	        No parameters
Use Case	Track input changes easily	                                Custom detection (deep objects/arrays)
Efficiency	Lightweight	                                                Can be performance-intensive if misused
Complexity	Simple and declarative	                                    Manual comparison logic needed
Can Be Used Together?	❌ Not recommended – can lead to complex behavior and bugs	

💡 When to Use ngDoCheck
Use it when:
You need to detect deep changes in nested objects or arrays.
External libraries mutate component state outside of Angular’s detection.
You are manually managing component state that isn't passed as @Input.

🧪 Example Scenario: Object Property Change Not Detected by ngOnChanges
code:
@Input() user: { name: string };

ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
  console.log("ngOnChanges", changes);
}

// Won't detect when only `user.name` changes without changing the reference
Use ngDoCheck instead:

code:
ngDoCheck() {
  if (this.user.name !== this.previousUserName) {
    console.log("User name changed");
    this.previousUserName = this.user.name;
  }
}

📚 How to Detect Array Changes Using ngDoCheck
code:
items = [1, 2, 3];
previousItems = [...this.items];

ngDoCheck() {
  if (this.items.length !== this.previousItems.length) {
    console.log("Array changed");
    this.previousItems = [...this.items];
  }
}

❓ Can ngDoCheck Replace ngOnChanges?
Not entirely. While it can be used for more complex detection, ngOnChanges is:
Easier to use
Provides SimpleChanges object
More efficient when you just want to track @Input() changes
Use ngDoCheck only when necessary.

🎯 Interview Cheat Sheet
1.What is ngDoCheck?
Custom change detection hook.
Called on every detection cycle.

2.Difference from ngOnChanges?
ngOnChanges: For @Input() only.
ngDoCheck: Manual detection for any changes.

Use case examples:
Deep object/array mutations.
External library side effects.

3.Array/Object comparison?
Use deep comparison or .length, JSON stringify, etc.

Best practices?
Avoid using ngOnChanges & ngDoCheck together.
Be careful of performance (as it runs every cycle).
