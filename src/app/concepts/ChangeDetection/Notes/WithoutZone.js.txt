What is Zone-less Angular?
Zone-less Angular removes reliance on zone.js, the library that traditionally patches async browser APIs to auto-trigger change detection in Angular apps.

Instead, Angular only triggers change detection when explicitly told to, such as:

When a signal value changes

When an event binding occurs ((click), etc.)

When manual APIs like ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck() or detectChanges() are used


How to Enable Zone-less Angular
Remove the zone.js polyfill
In angular.json, remove this line from polyfills:

"zone.js"
Enable experimental zone-less mode
In main.ts or app.config.ts, add:
import { provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection } from '@angular/core';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()],
});


Benefits of Going Zone-less
Performance Boost: Fewer automatic checks = faster UI updates

Reduced Bundle Size: No zone.js = smaller payload

Greater Control: You choose when to run change detection

Cleaner Debugging: Logs become meaningful without redundant re-evaluations

⚠️ Caveats
Manual responsibility: You must now manually control updates (or use reactive primitives like signals).

Third-party compatibility: Many libraries (e.g., Angular Material, Firebase, RxJS integrations) assume zone.js is present.

Experimental: Still under the provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection() flag, so may change in future Angular versions.

💡 Best Practice
Use zone-less mode when:
Your app is signal-driven
You want maximum performance
You can fully control async behavior
You're not relying on zone-dependent third-party libraries
