What is Change Detection?
Change detection is the internal Angular process that ensures the DOM reflects the current state of application data.
Automatically checks for changes when:
User events occur (e.g., clicks)
Asynchronous operations complete (e.g., HTTP calls)
Timers or observable streams update data
Angular uses Zone.js to know when asynchronous tasks are done and need change detection.

Zone.js – The Underlying Mechanism
Zone.js monkey patches async APIs like setTimeout, Promise, addEventListener, etc.
It notifies Angular when a task completes, triggering the change detection cycle.
Acts as a watchdog for any mutation that could affect the view.

Change Detection in Action – Component Tree
Angular walks through the component tree from top (root) to bottom.
It evaluates all data-bound expressions in templates ({{ }}, [property], (event)).
If a new value ≠ previous value → Angular updates the DOM.

Developer Tip: Getter Triggers

get countLabel() {
  console.log('Counter evaluated');
  return this.count();
}
If you bind this in the template: {{ countLabel }}, Angular re-evaluates it every time change detection runs.

❗ Avoid using getters for complex logic in templates.


Double Detection in Dev Mode
Why Logs Appear Twice? in Dev Mode
Development mode runs change detection twice:
First pass: Apply changes
Second pass: Validate if values remain the same

Purpose: Catch unexpected side-effects that alter values after change detection

Example: Math.random in Template

get randomValue() {
  return Math.random();
}
Used in template like:

<p>{{ randomValue }}</p>
Triggers:
ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError
Because:

First pass: 0.32745
Second pass: 0.65793 (different!)

random = Math.random();
get randomValue() {
  return this.random;
}

Production vs Development Mode
Mode	    Behavior	  Purpose
Development	Double change detection	Error detection and debugging
Production	Single change detection	Performance

In production builds:
Logs aren't repeated
No expression error unless real inconsistency occurs
