 Angular Route Navigation:
1. Using router.navigate() with Query Parameters:
Use case: When navigation must happen based on dynamic conditions (e.g., button click, logic inside the component).

How it's done:

code:
this.router.navigate(['employee-detail'], {
  queryParams: { id: empId, name: empName }
});


FAQ-style Questions and Answers:
📌 1. What is the navigate() method and when should it be used?
The navigate() method is part of Angular's Router service.
It's used to programmatically navigate to a route from within your TypeScript code.

Use it when:
You need more control over routing, such as setting query parameters.
Navigation is based on user actions like button clicks, form submissions, or business logic.

📌 2. How can you navigate to a route with query parameters using the navigate() method?
Example:
code:
this.router.navigate(['employee-detail'], {
  queryParams: { id: 2, name: 'Sanjay' }
});
This will generate a URL like:
/employee-detail?id=2&name=Sanjay

📌 3. What is the difference between using the navigate() method with query params and using routerLink with query params?

Feature	        routerLink	                                    navigate()
Approach	    Declarative (used in HTML templates)	        Programmatic (used in TypeScript)
Use case	    Static or known-at-design-time navigation	    Dynamic or logic-based navigation
Flexibility	    Less flexible	                                Highly flexible
Query Params	Set using [queryParams]="{...}"	                Set inside navigate() method

routerLink example:
<a [routerLink]="['/employee-detail']" [queryParams]="{ id: emp.id, name: emp.name }">View</a>

📌 4. How to clear existing query parameters using navigate()?
To reset or clear query parameters, pass an empty queryParams object:

code:
this.router.navigate(['employee-detail'], {
  queryParams: {}  // clears any existing params
});
