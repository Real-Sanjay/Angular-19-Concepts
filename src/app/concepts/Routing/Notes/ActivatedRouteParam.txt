ActivatedRoute & Route Parameters in Angular
When navigating to a route like /employees/101/John, and you want to fetch those values (101 and John) inside the component, you use ActivatedRoute.

What is ActivatedRoute?
ActivatedRoute is a service that gives access to information about the current route, such as
Route parameters (e.g., /employees/:id)
Query parameters (e.g., ?status=active)
Route data (static metadata)
Route fragments (#section1)

 Step-by-Step Example: Fetch Employee by ID and Name
Step 1: Define the Route with Parameters
code
// app-routing.module.ts
{ path: 'employees/:id/:name', component: EmployeesComponent }

Step 2: Fetch Parameters in Component
code
// employees.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-employees',
  templateUrl: './employees.component.html'
})
export class EmployeesComponent implements OnInit {
  id!: string;
  name!: string;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    const params = this.route.snapshot.params;
    this.id = params['id'];
    this.name = params['name'];

    console.log('ID:', this.id);
    console.log('Name:', this.name);
  }
}


Step 3: Display in Template
<!-- employees.component.html -->
<h2>Employee Details</h2>
<p><strong>ID:</strong> {{ id }}</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> {{ name }}</p>

Step 4: Add Router Outlet

<!-- app.component.html -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Navigate to the Route
In browser:

http://localhost:4200/employees/101/John
Output:
ID: 101
Name: John
Console:
ID: 101
Name: John


Quick Recap of Concepts
❓ Q1: How can you fetch the currently activated route info?
By injecting ActivatedRoute in the component and accessing:

code
this.route.snapshot.params['id']
❓ Q2: What is the snapshot?
The snapshot is a static representation of the route info at the moment the component is loaded.

It doesn’t update if the route changes while the component is still loaded.

Use snapshot when you’re sure route parameters won't change after initial load.

❓ Q3: When is snapshot preferred?
When you load data once during component init, like:

Fetching a blog post by ID

Fetching employee details

Viewing a product page
