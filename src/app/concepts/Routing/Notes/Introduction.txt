Angular Routing Essentials
✅ 1. What is Routing in Angular?
Routing is how Angular allows navigation between components based on URL paths, without reloading the page — using client-side routing.

✅ 2. Files Involved
app.routes.ts: Where all the route configurations are defined (paths + components).

app.config.ts: Where the provideRouter() function is called to activate the route list.

✅ 3. RouterOutlet
Acts like a placeholder to render the component based on the current route.

Usually declared in app.component.html.
code:
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

✅ 4. RouterLink
Used to link to routes without reloading the page. Example:
code:
<a routerLink="/home">Home</a>

Also usable with buttons:
code:
<button [routerLink]="['/employee', emp.id]">View</button>

✅ 5. Static vs Dynamic Routing
Feature	            Static Routing	                            Dynamic Routing
Definition	        Fixed URL paths	                            URL with parameters
Syntax	            { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }	{ path: 'employee/:id', component: EmployeeComponent }
Use Case	        Dashboards, About, Home	                    Product details, User profiles

Real-World Examples
E-commerce Application:
/products → List of products

/product/:id → View product detail page using dynamic routing

Employee Management System:
/employees → Show all employees

/employee/:empId/:name → Show profile of a specific employee
