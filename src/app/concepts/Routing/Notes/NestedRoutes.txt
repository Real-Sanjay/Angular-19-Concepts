Nested (Child) Routes in Angular
In Angular, nested routes or child routes allow you to structure your application in a parent-child hierarchy. This helps when building features like:
A user profile page with tabs (Overview, Settings, Orders)
A dashboard with different sections (Home, Reports, Users)

Implementation 
Let’s break it into steps:

1. Create Components

ng g component parent
ng g component parent/child-one
ng g component parent/child-two
This will generate:

parent
child-one inside parent
child-two inside parent

2. Define Nested Routes in app.routes.ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { ParentComponent } from './parent/parent.component';
import { ChildOneComponent } from './parent/child-one/child-one.component';
import { ChildTwoComponent } from './parent/child-two/child-two.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'parent',
    component: ParentComponent,
    children: [
      { path: 'child-one', component: ChildOneComponent },
      { path: 'child-two', component: ChildTwoComponent }
    ]
  }
];

3. Add router-outlet in Both AppComponent and ParentComponent
app.component.html:


<router-outlet></router-outlet>
parent.component.html:


<h2>Parent Component</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a routerLink="/parent/child-one">Child One</a></li>
  <li><a routerLink="/parent/child-two">Child Two</a></li>
</ul>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Output Behavior
Visiting /parent will render the ParentComponent.

Clicking on the links like /parent/child-one renders ChildOneComponent inside the <router-outlet> inside the parent.

Browser URL changes accordingly.

Practice Questions
Q1. How are child routes defined in Angular?
By using the children array property inside the parent route object. Each child route object contains path and component.

Q2. Can I define multiple child routes under one parent?
Yes. You can add as many objects (routes) inside the children array as needed.

Q3. Why is router-outlet needed inside the parent component?
The router-outlet in the parent is the placeholder where Angular will load the matched child component dynamically.

Q4. Can I have more than one router-outlet?
Yes. Angular supports named outlets for advanced layouts where you want multiple view areas on the same page.
