Route redirection allows you to automatically navigate a user from one path to another, typically used to:
Define default routes
Handle unmatched URLs (fallback)
Guide users to specific child components

Basic Syntax

{ path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }
🔸 Properties Explained:

Property	Purpose
path	    URL path to match (can be empty, specific, or wildcard)
redirectTo	The path to which the user should be redirected
pathMatch	Strategy to match the route - either full or prefix

Real Example
Let’s say we have the following component structure:
AppComponent
HomeComponent
ProductsComponent
ShirtsComponent

We want:

/ → redirect to /home

/products → redirect to /products/shirts

Any wrong path → redirect to /home

Routes Setup (app.routes.ts)

import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { ProductsComponent } from './products/products.component';
import { ShirtsComponent } from './products/shirts/shirts.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }, // default route
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  {
    path: 'products',
    component: ProductsComponent,
    children: [
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'shirts', pathMatch: 'full' }, // redirect inside products
      { path: 'shirts', component: ShirtsComponent }
    ]
  },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '/home' } // wildcard/fallback route
];

Important Notes
pathMatch: 'full' ensures the entire path must match exactly.
pathMatch: 'prefix' checks if the beginning of the URL matches.
For default child routes, use empty string '' as the path under the parent with redirectTo.
For fallback, use ** as the path (wildcard).

Output Behavior
Visiting / → Redirects to /home
Visiting /products → Redirects to /products/shirts
Visiting /unknown → Redirects to /home

Common Questions & Answers
Q1. What is the purpose of the redirectTo property?
The redirectTo property tells the router to automatically navigate to a different path when a specific route is matched.

Q2. What does pathMatch do and why is it important?
pathMatch determines how Angular matches a route:

full → Matches the whole path (commonly used in root redirects).

prefix → Matches if the URL starts with the path.

Without it, redirection may not work correctly.

Q3. What is a wildcard route and how is it used?
A wildcard route ({ path: '**', redirectTo: '/home' }) catches all unmatched routes and redirects the user, often to a fallback like the Home or NotFound component.

Q4. Can I have multiple redirects?
Yes. You can have multiple redirect routes, e.g., one for /, one for /products, and a wildcard for fallback.

Pro Tip
Always place the wildcard route at the end of your routes array — Angular checks routes top-down and matches the first one that fits.
