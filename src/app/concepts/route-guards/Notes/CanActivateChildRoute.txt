What is CanActivateChild?
Purpose: Controls whether child routes of a parent route can be activated.
Use case: Protects nested routes inside a parent route.

Returns:
true → allow access to the child route
false → block access (or redirect elsewhere)

Example:

Scenario	                                
Before clicking the "Enable Routes" button	Access to child routes is blocked
After clicking the button	Access to child routes is granted

we achive this by:
Creating a service to manage the button state (ButtonService).
Creating a CanActivateChild guard to check that button state before allowing child route access.
Navigating back to the parent route if the condition is not satisfied.

Note:
If both CanActivate and CanActivateChild are used in a routing setup,
CanActivateChild always executes first (for the child routes).

Quick Sketch of How the Guard Logic Works:

canActivateChild(
  childRoute: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
  state: RouterStateSnapshot
): boolean {
  if (this.buttonService.isButtonClicked()) {
    return true; // allow access
  } else {
    this.router.navigate(['/parent']); // redirect to parent
    return false; // block access
  }
}
