Difference Between Reactive Forms and Template-Driven Forms in Angular



Feature                         	Reactive Forms (ReactiveFormsModule)	                                    Template-Driven Forms (FormsModule)
Approach	                        Programmatic, model-driven	                                                Declarative, template-driven
Module Required	                    ReactiveFormsModule	                                                        FormsModule
Form Creation	                    Forms are defined in the component class using FormControl, FormGroup..	    Forms are defined directly in the HTML template using directives like ngModel
Data Binding	                    One-way binding: from model to view	                                        Two-way binding using [(ngModel)]
Validation Handling	                Defined programmatically using functions like Validators.required	        Defined in the template using directives like required, minlength, etc.
Scalability	                        Highly scalable and suitable for complex/dynamic forms	                    Best for simple, static forms
Form Control Tracking	            Full control over form state and validation through the component	        Angular tracks control state internally
Testing	                            Easier to write unit tests for reactive forms	                            More difficult to test due to logic being spread in the template
Flexibility	                        Can dynamically add/remove controls at runtime	                            Limited flexibility
Example Use Cases	                Complex registration forms, multi-step wizards, dynamic field generation	Simple contact forms, login pages


When to Use What?
Situation	                                                  Recommended Form Type
Simple form with a few fields	                              Template-driven (FormsModule)
Dynamic or conditionally-rendered fields	                  Reactive (ReactiveFormsModule)
Need detailed control over validation or form state	          Reactive Forms
Project involves many small forms with simple validations	  Template-driven Forms
