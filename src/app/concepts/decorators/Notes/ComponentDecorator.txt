 What is @Component?
The @Component decorator tells Angular that a class is a component and provides metadata that Angular uses to:
Create
Render
Style
Interact with the component

🛠️ Core Properties of @Component
Property	           Purpose
selector	           Defines the custom tag used in templates (<app-root></app-root>)
standalone	           Allows the component to be used without declaring in an NgModule
imports	               Modules or directives needed (like RouterModule, CommonModule)
templateUrl	           Path to the HTML file for this component
styleUrls	           Path(s) to CSS or SCSS file(s) for styling the component

✍️ Example: A Simple Component
code:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-greeting',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  templateUrl: './greeting.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./greeting.component.css']
})
export class GreetingComponent {
  name = 'Sanjay';
}

In app.component.html, you could now use:
<app-greeting></app-greeting>
And Angular will render the component’s HTML inside that tag.

✅ Extra @Component Properties You Can Use
Property	        Description
template	        You can directly write inline HTML like template: '<h1>Hello</h1>'
styles	            Inline styles instead of external file: styles: ['h1 { color: red; }']
animations	        Add Angular animations
providers	        Provide services specifically for this component
changeDetection	    Optimize performance with ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush

Why is standalone: true a big deal?
Before Angular 14, every component had to be declared inside a module.
But now with standalone: true, you can create fully self-contained components.
This makes it easier to:
Write reusable components
Do better lazy loading
Reduce complexity in small projects

📌 Summary
@Component is a class decorator that tells Angular how to process and display a component.
Core properties include selector, standalone, imports, templateUrl, and styleUrls.
standalone is especially useful in modern Angular for modular, plug-and-play components.
