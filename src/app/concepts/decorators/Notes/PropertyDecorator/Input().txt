What is @Input()?
@Input() is a property decorator that allows data to flow from parent to child component using property binding syntax.

It’s super useful when:
You want a child component to display or use data from its parent.
You want to create reusable and dynamic components.

📦 Basic Syntax
code:
import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>{{ receiveMessage }}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() receiveMessage: string = '';
}
In the parent component template:
code:
<app-child [receiveMessage]="displayMessage"></app-child>
This passes the value of displayMessage from parent to receiveMessage in the child.

🔄 Real-Time Example Recap
Your use case:
Parent (AppComponent) has a message and a button.
Child (ChildComponent) receives and displays the message.
When the button is clicked, it updates the message.

This demonstrates one-way binding — changes in the parent reflect in the child automatically.

🔍 Visual Flow
AppComponent (Parent)
 └── [receiveMessage]="displayMessage"
      ↓
ChildComponent (Child)
 └── @Input() receiveMessage
If displayMessage is updated → receiveMessage updates instantly.

Notes & Pro Tips
Renaming Input Property: You can alias it for clarity.
code:
@Input('message') receiveMessage: string;
Now, use it as:

code:
<app-child [message]="displayMessage"></app-child>

Input Types: You can pass numbers, objects, booleans, arrays — not just strings.
code:
@Input() userDetails: { name: string; age: number };

Input Setter for Custom Logic: You can run logic whenever the input value changes:
code:
private _name = '';

@Input() 
set name(value: string) {
  this._name = value.toUpperCase();
}

get name(): string {
  return this._name;
}
