@Output() and EventEmitter
Purpose:
Used to send data from a child component to a parent component by emitting custom events.

While @Input() is for parent → child communication,
@Output() is for child → parent communication.

 Syntax Breakdown
1. Child Component (Emits the event)
code:
import { Component, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<button (click)="emitEvent()">Click Me</button>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() myEvent: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();

  emitEvent() {
    this.myEvent.emit('Event emitted from child component');
  }
}

2. Parent Component (Receives the event)
In the .ts file:
code:
export class AppComponent {
  message: string = '';

  receiveChildEvent(event: string) {
    this.message = event;
  }
}

In the .html file:

<app-child (myEvent)="receiveChildEvent($event)"></app-child>
<p>{{ message }}</p>
💡 Flow Summary

ChildComponent:
  - Has an Output property of type EventEmitter
  - Emits a message via .emit()

AppComponent:
  - Listens to the event using (myEvent)="handler($event)"
  - Receives the data and stores it in a variable (message)

Interview-Friendly Answer
Q: How do you pass data from a child component to a parent component in Angular?

A:
We use the @Output() decorator along with Angular’s EventEmitter class. The @Output() marks a property in the child component that emits custom events. When the child emits an event using .emit(), the parent component listens for that event using event binding syntax like (eventName)="handler($event)". The parent can then handle the data passed from the child.

 Quick Facts
Feature	        Description
@Output()	    Marks a child component property as event-emitting
EventEmitter	Emits custom data (string, object, number, etc.)
Syntax	        (customEvent)="handler($event)"
Direction	    Child → Parent

 Real-World Usage Examples
Notify parent when a form is submitted from a child.
Send selected item from a dropdown in a reusable child component.
Trigger an update or refresh in parent when something changes in the child.
