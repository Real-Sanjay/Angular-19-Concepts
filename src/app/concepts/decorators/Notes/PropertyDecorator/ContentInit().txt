Key Differences between @ViewChild and @ContentChild

Feature	                        @ViewChild	                                                                    @ContentChild
Purpose	                Access elements or components from the component’s own template	                        Access projected content (i.e., content passed from parent to child using <ng-content>)
When to Use	            When you want to access and manipulate elements inside the component's own view	        When you want to access and manipulate elements passed from outside (i.e., parent component)
DOM Access	            Can manipulate DOM of its own component	                                                Can manipulate DOM of projected (transcluded) content
Lifecycle Hook	        ngAfterViewInit()	                                                                        ngAfterContentInit()
Example Use Case	    Calling a method of a child component or changing inner text of a button in template	Styling or manipulating projected content like <p>, <h3>, etc., passed from parent


Summary of Lifecycle Hooks Used:
ngAfterViewInit()
Used with @ViewChild to ensure that the view (and the child components or DOM elements) has been initialized before accessing it.

ngAfterContentInit()
Used with @ContentChild because this hook is triggered after Angular projects the external content into the component's view. This ensures that the projected content is available for reference and manipulation.

Real-Life Analogy:
@ViewChild is like accessing things inside your own house — you can easily reach and modify your furniture (your own DOM/template elements).

@ContentChild is like modifying a gift brought by a friend — the friend (parent component) brings something (HTML content), and once they hand it over (via <ng-content>), you can customize it (manipulate its styles, access its values, etc.).


Questions Recap:
1. What is the purpose of @ViewChild decorator?
The @ViewChild decorator is used to get a reference to a DOM element, directive, or component present within the component’s own template. It allows for DOM manipulation or calling methods/properties of child components.

2. What is the purpose of @ContentChild decorator?
The @ContentChild decorator is used to get a reference to content projected into a component using <ng-content>. This is useful for accessing or modifying externally passed content.

3. Which lifecycle hook is used with @ViewChild, and why?
ngAfterViewInit() is used because it's called after the component's view (and its children) have been initialized. Accessing the view before this hook may result in undefined.

4. Which lifecycle hook is used with @ContentChild, and why?
ngAfterContentInit() is used because it's called after Angular projects external content into the component's view, making it the right place to interact with projected elements.
