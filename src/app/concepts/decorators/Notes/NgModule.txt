🧱 @NgModule() — Explained with Real Example
Although Angular 17 and above use standalone components, many large projects still use modules or hybrid setups. So understanding @NgModule is still very important.

Here’s how an @NgModule looks in code:

code:
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { DemoComponent } from './demo/demo.component';
import { MyService } from './services/my.service';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    DemoComponent    // ✅ Declaring the component
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule     // ✅ Importing built-in module
  ],
  providers: [
    MyService         // ✅ Providing a service
  ],
  bootstrap: [
    AppComponent      // ✅ Setting root component
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
📦 NgModule Properties (Quick Summary)

Property	    Description
declarations	List of components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module
imports	Other   modules to bring their exported components/directives/services
providers	    Services or guards available to this module (used in DI)
bootstrap	    Root component to load when app starts


Real-World Analogy
Think of @NgModule() like a container or toolbox that holds:
Tools (components)
Other toolboxes (imported modules)
Utility services (providers)
Entry tool (bootstrap component)

So Angular knows how to assemble your application and where to start.
⚡ Why Learn NgModule Even with Angular 17?
Although Angular 17 introduced standalone components, here's why NgModule is still useful:

You’ll find it in most enterprise projects
It’s essential for:
Lazy loading modules
Shared modules
Organizing big applications
Some third-party libraries still rely on it

✅ Summary
@NgModule() is a class decorator used to define a module in Angular.
Even though Angular 17+ supports standalone components, learning NgModule is important.
It helps organize and register components, services, and other dependencies.
Core properties: declarations, imports, providers, and bootstrap.
