 What is a Decorator in Angular?
In Angular, decorators are special functions prefixed with @ that add metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters. They help Angular understand how to process and instantiate various elements in your app.

 Class Decorators
Class decorators are applied to a class definition and are used to define what type of class it is — for example:


Decorator	Purpose
@Component	Tells Angular it's a component
@Directive	Tells Angular it's a directive
@Injectable	Tells Angular it's a service that can be injected
@Pipe	    Tells Angular it's a custom pipe
@NgModule	Tells Angular it's a module (container of components, directives, services, etc.)
