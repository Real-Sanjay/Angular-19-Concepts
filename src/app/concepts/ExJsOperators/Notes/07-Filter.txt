RxJS filter Operator
What Is It?
The filter operator in RxJS is used to emit only those items from the source observable that satisfy a given condition.
This condition is provided by a predicate function, which returns true or false.

Similar to: JavaScript’s Array.prototype.filter(), but for observables.

Basic Syntax
import { from } from 'rxjs';
import { filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

const source$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);

source$.pipe(
  filter(value => value % 2 === 0)  // Only even numbers
).subscribe(val => console.log(val));
 Output:

2
4
6

How the Predicate Function Works
Receives each emitted value.
Returns:
true → emit the value.
false → skip the value.

Example: Filtering Objects by Property

import { from } from 'rxjs';
import { filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

const people$ = from([
  { name: 'Alice', age: 28 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 22 },
  { name: 'David', age: 40 }
]);

people$.pipe(
  filter(person => person.age >= 30)
).subscribe(person => console.log(`${person.name}: ${person.age}`));

Output:
Bob: 34
David: 40
val represents each emitted object, and you can access its properties directly in the predicate.

When to Use filter
To exclude unwanted values (e.g., nulls, duplicates, invalid entries).
To emit values matching specific criteria (e.g., status, category, age).
To streamline data processing before transforming or combining it.

Summary
The filter operator is powerful and intuitive. It allows you to extract only the data you need from a stream based on custom logic, making your observable pipelines more efficient and focused.
