RxJS empty (Deprecated) and EMPTY Constant
What is EMPTY?
EMPTY is a constant from RxJS that creates an observable that:
Emits no values
Immediately completes

import { EMPTY } from 'rxjs';

EMPTY.subscribe({
  next: val => console.log('Value:', val),
  complete: () => console.log('Completed')
});
Output:
Completed

Why not empty()?
The function empty() is deprecated in the latest RxJS versions.
Use the EMPTY constant instead for better compatibility and clarity.

Comparison Example: of() vs EMPTY
import { of, EMPTY } from 'rxjs';

const source1$ = of(1, 2, 3);
const source2$ = EMPTY;

source1$.subscribe({
  next: val => console.log('Source1:', val),
  complete: () => console.log('Source1 Complete')
});

source2$.subscribe({
  next: val => console.log('Source2:', val),
  complete: () => console.log('Source2 Complete')
});
Output:
Source1: 1
Source1: 2
Source1: 3
Source1 Complete
Source2 Complete

Use Cases of EMPTY
Used to short-circuit a stream when there's no data to emit
Can be returned in switchMap, mergeMap, etc., to terminate or skip emissions
Great for scenarios where we need to complete silently without errors or data

Is EMPTY the same as complete()?

Feature	        EMPTY	                                             complete()
What is it?	    An RxJS observable constant                        	A method in the observer object
Used for?	    Creating an observable that completes immediately	Indicating an observable has completed
Emits values?	❌ No	                                           ❌ No
Part of RxJS?	✅ Yes	                                           ✅ Yes
⚠️ They may seem similar but serve different purposes:

EMPTY creates an observable.
complete() is a callback that marks an observable as done.
Summary
✅ Use EMPTY to create a no-value, instantly-completing observable.
❌ Avoid empty() — it is deprecated.
Great for scenarios where no data needs to be emitted but stream control is still required.
