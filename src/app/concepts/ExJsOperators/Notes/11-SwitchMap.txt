RxJS switchMap Operator
What is it?
switchMap is a higher-order mapping operator.
It maps each value from a source observable to a new inner observable.
Switches to the new observable and cancels the previous one if it hasn’t completed.
Only the latest inner observable’s emissions are considered.

Use Case Scenario
Imagine a user typing into a search bar:
Each keystroke fires an HTTP request.
You only care about the latest request (i.e., the most recent typed word).
switchMap cancels all previous HTTP requests and only processes the latest one.

Code Example
import { of, interval } from 'rxjs';
import { switchMap, take } from 'rxjs/operators';

const source$ = of(1, 2, 3);

source$
  .pipe(
    switchMap(val => {
      console.log(`Source emitted: ${val}`);
      console.log('Starting new inner observable...');
      return interval(1000).pipe(take(3));
    })
  )
  .subscribe(data => console.log(`Inner emitted: ${data}`));
Output Behavior:
On first source emission (1), interval(1000) starts.
Before interval emits all 3 values, the next source value (2) arrives.
The current inner observable is canceled, and a new one starts.
This happens for each source emission — only the final inner observable completes.

Difference: switchMap vs concatMap

Feature	                 switchMap	                                concatMap
Inner Observable	     Canceled on new source emission	        Waits to complete before moving to the next
Order Maintained?	     ❌ No	                                  ✅ Yes
Concurrency	             Only 1 active inner observable at a time	Sequential, one after another
Use Case	             Live search, typeahead, autocomplete	    Sequential requests, task queues
Memory Manageme   Efficient (no accumulation of inner observables)	Risk of piling up if many emissions

Q&A
Q: What does switchMap do in RxJS?
A: switchMap maps each source emission to an inner observable but cancels any previously active inner observable. It's useful when you only care about the latest result — like in autocomplete or real-time user input scenarios.

Q: How is switchMap different from concatMap?
A: concatMap queues inner observables and waits for each to finish before starting the next, preserving order. In contrast, switchMap cancels the previous observable whenever a new value is emitted, processing only the most recent one.
