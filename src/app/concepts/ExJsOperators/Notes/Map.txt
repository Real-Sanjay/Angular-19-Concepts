RxJS map Operator
What Is It?
The map operator in RxJS is used to transform each value emitted by an observable using a provided function.
It is pure and returns a new observable without modifying the original one.

Similar to: JavaScript's Array.prototype.map() – but for observables.

Basic Syntax

import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const numbers$ = of(1, 2, 3, 4);

const doubled$ = numbers$.pipe(
  map(n => n * 2)
);

doubled$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:
2
4
6
8
The transformation function (called the project function) gets each emitted value (n) and returns the transformed one.

Example 2: Mouse Coordinates
Scenario:
Track mouse movement and extract x and y coordinates.

import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

cursorPosition$ = fromEvent<MouseEvent>(window, 'mousemove').pipe(
  map(event => ({
    x: event.clientX,
    y: event.clientY
  }))
);
Angular Template Binding:

<p>Cursor X: {{ cursorPosition$ | async?.x }}</p>
<p>Cursor Y: {{ cursorPosition$ | async?.y }}</p>
The async pipe subscribes to the observable and auto-unsubscribes.

 The ?. (optional chaining) avoids errors when the observable value is still undefined.

 Why Use map?
To transform raw data (e.g., numbers, event objects, responses).

To format values for UI or further processing.

To simplify logic inside pipelines.

Question
How does the map operator work in RxJS?
The map operator is a transformation operator in RxJS that applies a project function to each value emitted by an observable. It returns a new observable with the transformed values, leaving the original observable unchanged. Just like JavaScript’s map, it processes values one-by-one, but works on data streams instead of arrays.
