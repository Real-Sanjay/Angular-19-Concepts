 of() Operator 
Purpose:

The of() operator is a creation operator in RxJS that allows you to create an observable from a list of values.
Each value becomes a separate emission in the observable sequence.
After all values are emitted, the observable completes.

Key Features:
Emits each argument as a next notification.
Can emit numbers, strings, arrays, objects, or functions.
Useful for creating test observables or simple data streams.

Example:

import { of } from 'rxjs';

const obs$ = of(1, 2, 3, 4);
obs$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:

1
2
3
4
It also works with other types:

const mixed$ = of(
  { name: 'Sanjay', age: 25 },
  [1, 2, 3],
  () => 'Hello from function'
);
mixed$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));


Questions:
What is the purpose of the of() operator in RxJS?
Answer:
The of() operator creates an observable that emits a set of values in the given order and then completes. Each argument passed to of() becomes one emission in the stream.
