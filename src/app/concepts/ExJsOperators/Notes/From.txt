from() Operator in RxJS
Purpose:
The from() operator is a creation operator that converts almost any data type into an observable stream, including arrays, promises, strings, maps, sets, and more.

Key Features:
Emits each element individually from iterable sources (like arrays, strings, maps, sets).
For promises, it emits the resolved value and then completes.
Great for converting existing data structures into observable streams.

Examples:
1️⃣ From an Array:

import { from } from 'rxjs';

const obs$ = from([10, 20, 30]);
obs$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:
10
20
30

2️⃣ From a Promise:
const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
  resolve('Promise resolved!');
});

const obs$ = from(promise);
obs$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:
Promise resolved!

3️⃣ From a Map:
const map = new Map();
map.set('a', 1);
map.set('b', 2);

const obs$ = from(map);
obs$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:
['a', 1]
['b', 2]


from() vs of() Comparison

Feature	                    from()	                                of()
Input	            Iterable, Promise, Map, Set, String, etc.	    Any values passed as arguments
Emission	        Emits each value/item individually	            Emits each argument as a whole
Array Behavior	    Emits each array element one by one	            Emits the entire array as one value
Use Case	        Convert existing data sources into observables	Create observable from static values


Question:
What is the difference between from() and of() in RxJS?
Answer:
from() is used to convert iterable data types like arrays, promises, or collections into observables that emit values one by one. In contrast, of() creates an observable that emits each argument passed to it as a separate emission. For example, of([1,2,3]) emits one value (the array), while from([1,2,3]) emits 1, 2, and 3 separately.
