RxJS Pipeable Operators
What Are Pipeable Operators?
Pipeable operators are functions used with the .pipe() method to operate on observables.
They transform, filter, or combine data emitted by observables without mutating the original observable.
The .pipe() method is used to chain multiple operators.

Syntax Example

import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const source$ = of(1, 2, 3);

const result$ = source$.pipe(
  map(value => value * 2)
);

result$.subscribe(val => console.log(val));
Output:
2
4
6

Another Example with Strings

import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const cities$ = of('mumbai', 'delhi', 'bangalore');

cities$.pipe(
  map(city => city.toUpperCase())
).subscribe(val => console.log(val));

Output:
MUMBAI
DELHI
BANGALORE

 Why Use the pipe() Function?
✅ Enables operator chaining in a clean, readable, and maintainable way.

✅ Encourages separation of concerns: each operator does one job.

✅ Keeps the original observable intact (pure and functional style).

✅ Supports reusability by composing operators together.

What is Operator Chaining with pipe()?
Operator chaining refers to passing multiple operators inside a .pipe() function.
Each operator processes the output of the previous operator.

Analogy: Similar to chaining .then() in JavaScript promises or function composition.

source$.pipe(
  operator1(),
  operator2(),
  operator3()
);

Multiple Questions, One Answer
Q1: What is the use of pipe() in RxJS?
Q2: What is the advantage of pipeable operators?
Q3: Explain operator chaining using pipe.
🟩 Single Unified Answer:
The pipe() function in RxJS allows chaining multiple operators in a clean and sequential way. It improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability by separating logic into modular steps that transform or handle data from the observable.
