Understanding NgForm Directive vs NgForm Class
🔹 NgForm Directive
The NgForm directive is a built-in Angular directive used in template-driven forms.
It is applied automatically when you use #myForm="ngForm" on a <form> element.
It creates and associates an instance of the NgForm class to the form element in the template.
This directive is responsible for:
Enabling Angular’s two-way binding and validation.
Tracking the form state (like valid, invalid, touched, untouched, etc.).
Connecting NgModel directives to form controls.

Example:

code:
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="submitForm(myForm)">
  <input name="username" [(ngModel)]="user.username" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

🔸 NgForm Class
The NgForm class comes from Angular’s @angular/forms module.
It represents the structure and logic behind the form.
When the ngForm directive is added to a form, it internally creates an instance of this class.
This class provides important properties/methods like:
form: the underlying FormGroup object.
valid, invalid, pristine, dirty, etc.
controls: access to individual form controls.

TypeScript Usage:

import { NgForm } from '@angular/forms';

submitForm(form: NgForm) {
  if (form.valid) {
    console.log(this.user.username);
    alert('Form Submitted!');
  }
}
🆚 Summary: Directive vs Class

Feature	            ngForm Directive	                NgForm Class
What it is	        A directive applied on form	        A class managing form behavior
Where it’s used	    In the template (HTML)	            In the component (TypeScript)
Purpose	            Creates instance of NgForm	        Encapsulates form's logic and state
How it's connected	Via #formName="ngForm"	            Via parameter in TS method

Conclusion
When you write:
code:
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="submitForm(myForm)">
You're telling Angular:
"Please create an instance of the NgForm class using the ngForm directive and assign it to the reference myForm."
Then, when the form is submitted, you get access to all its states and methods through the class instance in your component logic.
