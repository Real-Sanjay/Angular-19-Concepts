What is a String-Based Injection Token in Angular?
In Angular, tokens help the Dependency Injection (DI) system identify what dependency to inject.
Instead of using a class (type token) as the token, you can also use a string.
These are known as string-based tokens, and they work similarly to class tokens, but with a small twist.

Why Use String Tokens?
When you don’t have a class to represent your dependency (like a config object).
When you want to provide different versions of the same service or value under different names.
They can also be used to make DI more flexible — but should be used carefully to avoid name collisions.

Practical Example:
Step 1: Create the Service
code:
// log-message-one.service.ts
export class LogMessageOneService {
  log(): void {
    console.log('Log from Service One');
  }
}
Step 2: Provide the Service Using a String Token
code:
// app.component.ts
import { Component, Inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { LogMessageOneService } from './services/log-message-one.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'LOG_MESSAGE_ONE', //  string token
      useClass: LogMessageOneService
    }
  ]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(
    @Inject('LOG_MESSAGE_ONE') private logger: LogMessageOneService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.logger.log();
  }
}

@Inject('LOG_MESSAGE_ONE') tells Angular:
“Hey, don’t guess which service I want — use this exact token to resolve the dependency.”

Why Do We Need the @Inject() Decorator?
Normally, Angular can look at the type in the constructor and figure out what to inject:

code:
constructor(private myService: MyService) {}  // Angular guesses based on type
But if you’re using non-class tokens (like strings, objects, symbols), Angular can’t guess.

So you need to explicitly tell Angular what token to use via @Inject():

code:
constructor(@Inject('TOKEN_NAME') private myService: SomeService) {}

What Happens If You Forget @Inject()?
You’ll see an error like:
NullInjectorError: No provider for Object!
That’s Angular saying:

“You gave me a string token but didn’t tell me which one to use!”

⚠️ Best Practice Tip:
Avoid using duplicate string tokens. They can override each other silently, which leads to confusing bugs.

Instead: 
✅ Always create unique token strings, or better —
✅ Use InjectionToken for better safety (we’ll cover this next if you’re ready!)

📌 Summary

Concept	Meaning
String Token	    A string used as a key to register and resolve dependencies
@Inject()	        A decorator that tells Angular what token to use
Why Needed	        Angular can’t guess what to inject from a string — so you must tell it
Common Use Case	    When you want to inject configs, values, or multiple versions of a service
