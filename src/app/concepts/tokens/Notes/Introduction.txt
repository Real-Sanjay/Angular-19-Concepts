What Are Injection Tokens in Angular?
In Angular, an Injection Token acts like a unique key used by Angular’s Dependency Injection (DI) system to identify and retrieve a dependency.

Why Do We Need Injection Tokens?
In many real-world apps, we often have multiple services of the same type or non-class values (like strings, config objects) to inject.
If Angular relied only on the type of the class, it wouldn't know which service to inject when multiple services share the same structure.
Hence, Injection Tokens solve this by acting like custom identifiers (keys) for DI.

Example: Basic Token-Based Service Injection
1. Create Two Services
code:
// log-message-one.service.ts
export class LogMessageOneService {
  log(): void {
    console.log('This is log message from service ONE');
  }
}

// log-message-two.service.ts
export class LogMessageTwoService {
  log(): void {
    console.log('This is log message from service TWO');
  }
}
2. Use Token in a Component
code:
import { Component, inject, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { LogMessageOneService } from './services/log-message-one.service';
import { LogMessageTwoService } from './services/log-message-two.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'LOGGER',         // 🔑 Token (String token in this case)
      useClass: LogMessageOneService // 👈 You can switch to LogMessageTwoService here
    }
  ]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  logger = inject<any>('LOGGER'); // 💡 Injecting by token instead of class type

  ngOnInit() {
    this.logger.log();
  }
}
You can easily switch between different implementations by changing the useClass:

code:
useClass: LogMessageTwoService

Types of Tokens

Token Type	       Description
Type Token	    Usually a class type. Most common.
String Token	Simple string used as a key (not recommended for large apps due to possible collisions).
InjectionToken	Strongly typed and unique object token (preferred for complex scenarios).



Property	Purpose
useClass	Use a specific class to create a new instance
useValue	Provide a constant or config object
useExisting	Use an existing service instance
useFactory	Use a factory function to return a value/service
We’ll dig into these in upcoming examples.


Questions:

What are injection tokens in Angular?
Tokens uniquely identify a dependency in Angular’s DI system, especially useful when multiple providers or non-class values are used.

What is the use of useClass?
Specifies the class to be instantiated when a dependency associated with the token is requested.

What’s the difference between provide and useClass?
provide: Specifies the token (the unique key).
useClass: Specifies the implementation (class) to be used when the token is injected.

What happens if the same token is used with multiple useClass values?
Angular will use the last one defined in the providers array. Earlier ones will be overridden.
